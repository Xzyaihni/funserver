# funserver
lol lmao even

if u use it on a local network for wutever reason:
```
git clone https://github.com/Xzyaihni/funserver
cd funserver
cargo b -r
cd target/release
```

then create a certificate file with the secret key thingy in the same file and name it cert.pem
if u connect to it it tries to open index.html file in the working directory
(and opens anything else the get request asks it to)

```
./funserver
```

uhhh yea
